;; This code defines and runs a genetic programming system on the problem
;; of finding a function that fits a particular set of [x y] pairs.

;; The aim here is mostly to demonstrate how genetic programming can be
;; implemented in Clojure simply and clearly, and several things are
;; done in somewhat inefficient and/or non-standard ways. But this should
;; provide a reasonable starting point for developing more efficient/
;; standard/capable systems.

;; Note also that this code, as written, will not always find a solution.
;; There are a variety of changes that one might make to improve its
;; problem-solving performance on the given problem.

;; We'll use data from x^2 + x + 1 (the problem from chapter 4 of
;; http://www.gp-field-guide.org.uk/, although our gp algorithm won't
;; be the same, and we'll use some different parameters as well).

;; We'll use input (x) values ranging from -1.0 to 1.0 in increments
;; of 0.1, and we'll generate the target [x y] pairs algorithmically.
;; If you want to evolve a function to fit your own data then you could
;; just paste a vector of pairs into the definition of target-data instead.



;; Remove unneeded key-value pairs from data
